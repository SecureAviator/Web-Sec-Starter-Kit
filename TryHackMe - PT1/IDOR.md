Access Control Vulnerability:

- IDOR stands for Insecure Direct Object Reference and is a type of access control vulnerability.

- This type of vulnerability can occur when a web server receives user-supplied input to retrieve objects (files, data, documents), too much trust has been placed on the input data, and it is not validated on the server-side to confirm the requested object belongs to the user requesting it.

- IDOR vulnerabilities can be found via Encoded, Hashed or Unpredictable IDs in URLs or Endpoints.
